# Springboot Java Project

This project was generated with Spring Boot Java-based framework and reference for setting up a new Maven-based Java project. It contains most of the tricks I've learned over the QEA Program at [Tech Talent South](https://www.techtalentsouth.com/).  
When I started a new Java project, I follow my instructor to build from the scratch utilize the cool features of [Spring Boot](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-start) framework. 
The project includes the common REST API, The Business logic, MVC (Module View Controller), ORM (Object Relational Mapping), and the Database.
